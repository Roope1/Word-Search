# Word search - Trie Data Structure

A simple application that checks whether a word you insert existst in the [words_alpha.txt](words_alpha.txt) file by first reading all the words into a [trie data structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie).

The words_alpha file is taken from https://github.com/dwyl/english-words and I take no credit for the file.

Everything else present in this repository is fully my own work.
